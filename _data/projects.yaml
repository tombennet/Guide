    title: Design Guide Refresh
    short_description: Simplify the Bitcoin Design Guide to make it easier for builders to get their questions answered.
    long_description: >
      The Bitcoin Design Guide is a substantial and detailed resource. Let’s simplify the
      content & navigation to make it easier for builders to get their questions answered.
      Through user interviews, we'll discover pain points to inform the way forward. Let’s
      get more people visiting the Guide, using the Guide and deriving value from the Guide.
      The Guide should become an essential destination for anyone building on bitcoin.

      Let’s make it easier for builders to build with actual code examples and components.
      We need to embrace the way AI is changing how the world designs and builds, so let’s
      empower vibe coders to help them bring to life great bitcoin UX with a few prompts.

    title: Bring Design to the Protocol
    short_description: Help devs communicate the user value of BIPs with design collateral early in the product lifecycle.
    long_description: >
      The Design Community can wield Design to help bitcoin devs and researchers advance
      their proposals for improving the bitcoin protocol, and related protocols (BIPs, BOLTs,
      BLIPs, NIPs etc). Designers can crystallise user value and bring to life the storytelling
      around abstract proposals in a way that technical contributors often can not. There is a
      huge opportunity for designers to insert themselves in the earliest phases of bitcoin R&D
      work to champion use cases, sell the value proposition and help user-positive changes gain
      rough consensus.

    short_description: Experiment with new ways to use bitcoin in applications and inspire others to do the same.
    long_description: >
      The world has changed—with AI tools anyone can now build anything. And bitcoin (and
      lightning and related infrastructure) is now easier to use than ever. A massive wave of
      creative builder energy is about to be unleashed. We in the Design Community can show the
      way forward through experimentation, prototyping and community-driven exploration. When
      value can flow instantly and permissionlessly across borders—what might the world build?
      Let’s find out.

    title: Adopting the ₿ symbol
    short_description: Drive accessibility of the ₿ symbol in fonts and keyboards so it becomes standard everywhere.
    long_description: >
      Embracing the ₿ symbol as bitcoin’s fundamental unit is a user-positive, future-oriented
      change—especially when thinking about payments use cases and large scale adoption. We should
      all have interest in ensuring bitcoin doesn't disappear from quantities. We should
      simultaneously increase the accessibility of using the ₿ symbol (e.g. in fonts, on keyboards).
      Our aim with this initiative will be ubiquitous ₿ symbol use throughout the bitcoin ecosystem.

      BIP-353 represents a better, more interoperable and human-readable addressing scheme for bitcoin.
      It’s time to drive its adoption throughout the ecosystem. We'll communicate clear best practices for UX,
      implementation, naming and usage. The Design Community will champion its adoption across the industry
      through active advocacy and explore applicability in new applications (like AI agents).

      The Design Community should be on the front lines of the messy bitcoin narrative-shaping and
      consensus-building conversations that happen all day, and every day on social media. Design can be a
      strong voice for the user, for consistency, for simplicity—everywhere. A more vibrant presence on X
      that engages the bitcoin product building community with design topics, advocacy, debate, design crit
      and more. More podcasts, regular Spaces, more debate—content that builders and influencers will see,
      amplify and value.

      Stablecoins are coming—in a big way. The Design Community can & should lead the charge with research
      and storytelling work to identify the ways in which bitcoin separates itself as the superior form of
      “new digital money” for the whole world. Shout the use cases, the unique value, why the world should care.

      putting exceptional bitcoin design craft, design thinking into the world. Such a real-world showcase will
      become the reference points to which builders across the ecosystem should aspire. We can bring a new level
      of design culture to bitcoin writ large.

      As new “Layer 2s” proliferate, the Design Community should be the voice of simplicity and consistency.
      The voice for bitcoin. Let’s resist the temptation to bring L2 brands and L2 language into UIs wherever
      possible. Let’s have the technology disappear. Yet, let’s make sure trust assumptions and risks are clear,
      and well-understood. It may take some new language, some new metaphors. Let’s explore the best way to keep
      bitcoin simple, consistent and interoperable even as the complexity of the entire system continues to grow.

      improving human lives. We can build a digestible, searchable, useful and inspiring resource that showcases
      the positive uses. Such a “user story bank” can help dispel counternarratives, can be a valuable source of
      information for media and can be a source of inspiration for brand work.

      culture of “customer service” to serve the needs of the industry. We can make it fast and easy for anyone to
      ask and answer questions. We can increase the ways in which industry designers engage with us. We can help
      people get started, get contributing, get building more quickly. Let’s explore new tools, new processes, new
      ways of working. The open community is here to help.

      This should include best practices for FROST/Taproot and Private Collaborative Custody. All savings wallets should

      non-profits to small businesses to strategic reserves for nation states. The UX will need to consider maximizing
      coin security, maximizing personal safety, minimizing fraud as well as considering transparency and the transfer
      of power. Important work!
